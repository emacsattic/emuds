At first install EMACS. Unix users may either install it from their
distribution, or compile the most actual version from scratch after
download from L<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/>. I provided ready to
run zip archives of EMACS_for_Windows, as gamers dislike running a
compiler.

Next download either L<eMUDs-2005-08-14.zip> as a ZIP archive 
or L<eMUDs-2005-08-14.tar.gz> as GZIP over GTAR.

Proceed with Files_in_Detail or Installing_eMUDs
