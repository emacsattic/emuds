eMUDs is a MUD_Client written in EMACS.

Well, i have not used emacs before. It was to complex to me.
I was of course able to configure; make ;make install it.
GNU is used to run out of the box. But i still use vi, 20
years of Unix cant change in a day.

I started to write eMUDs because Tinyfugue came to its limits.
I was in need of a real programming language to code triggers,
hotkeys channels and lots of other things. I evaluated several
mud clients, none of them offered the flexibility I needed.

So I decided to write my own full featured MUD_Client from
scratch. The first decision was the runtime environment and
programming language. I decided on EMACS and LISP. EMACS is
free software, and available for a lot of operating systems.
LISP was designed to solve AI problems, and is well suited
for releasing the player from the burden of repeating tasks.
