At first download and install EMACS as described in Downloading_eMUDs and
EMACS_for_Windows. Linux or Unix users will skip, as EMACS is provided by
most vendors.

Create the following directories and file :

| | Unix | Windows |
| Directory | $HOME/.emuds/ | C:\GNU\emuds\ |
| Directory | $HOME/.emuds-maps/ | C:\GNU\emuds-maps\ |
| Directory | $HOME/.emuds-logs/ | C:\GNU\emuds-logs\ |
| File | $HOME/.emuds-db | C:\GNU\emuds-db |

Next step is downloading the eMUDs archive. Unix users will unpack the
eMUDs-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz into $HOME/.emuds/, while Windows users should
unpack the eMUDs-YYYY-MM-DD.zip into C:\GNU\emuds\. Both need to create
their eMUDs directory first.

Now edit the emuds.emacs file to adopt your directory paths. And
create a symlink from emuds.emacs to either $HOME/.emacs on Unix
or copy it to C:\_emacs on Windows.

Proceed with Starting_and_Stopping_eMUDs.
