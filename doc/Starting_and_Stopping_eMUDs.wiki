All eMUDs_Commands start with a slash. This is handy as tinifudge was
also using the / to start commands, and i could convert my old chars
by giving the eMUDs commands the same name. eMUDs_Commands can also
be given interactive, and you have to start the game by running /emuds
interactive. This is normaly done with &lt;m-x&gt;/emuds&lt;cr&gt;.

Some usefull keyboard commands :

| &lt;m-x&gt;/emuds&lt;cr&gt; | start the game |
| &lt;m-x&gt;/quit&lt;cr&gt; | disconnects |
| &lt;c-x&gt;52 | creates a new frame - try this with the output window |
| &lt;c-x&gt;50 | deletes a frame - dont do this with the game frame |
| &lt;c-x&gt;&lt;c-c&gt; | quit's the EMACS editor |

Now &lt;m-x&gt; or &lt;c-x&gt; are shorthand notations for meta-x and control-x.
Personal computer keyboards dont have a meta key, so the alt key has
to serve this.
